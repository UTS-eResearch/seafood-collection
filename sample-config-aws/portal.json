		"title": "Project Overview",
		"text":"<p>The <em>Transforming Australian Shellfish Production Project</em> (TASPP) follows on from the success of the NSW Oyster Industry Transformation Project (NSWOITP), which is a UTS led, multidisciplinary collaboration between oyster farmers (NSW Farmers Association), researchers (UTS, DPI Aquaculture and Fisheries), regulators (DPI Biosecurity and Food Safety) and the Food Agility CRC. Hunter Local Land Services (LLS) has been an important partner in the Manning, Wallis Lake and Port Stephens estuaries, funding the installation of hardware in the Manning and working in partnership with MidCoast Council to improve catchment management and reduce water quality impacts on the oyster industry. The project uses real time, high-resolution salinity, temperature and depth sensing, combined with novel molecular genetic methods (eDNA), to model oyster food safety, pathogenic bacteria, harmful algae, and oyster growth and disease, with the aim of changing harvest management and to reduce harvest closure days for farmers.</p> <br><p>As filter feeders, shellfish like oysters and mussels actively remove particles from surrounding waterways. Following high-risk events such as heavy rainfall or harmful algal blooms, regulators like the NSW Food Authority implement precautionary harvest area closures to manage potential food safety risks or implement shellfish movement restrictions to manage potential biosecurity risks. <br>Shellfish farmers in Australia are not currently able to predict the likelihood of a harvest area closure due to these high-risk events. If farmers were aware of imminent closure, they could take meaningful action such as harvesting early, or moving stock to lower risk areas of their lease. The same environmental variables that influence food safety can also impact on oysters' health and can increase the risk of certain diseases. Understanding these relationships and monitoring these variables could be used to reduce the risk and severity of disease outbreaks.</p> <br><p>This project will deliver functioning, estuary-specific models relating to oyster growth, disease risk, harmful algal bloom risk, sources of contamination, and other supporting factors influencing industry productivity. Each of these models will relate biological data to high frequency water quality metrics as measured by real-time sensors deployed in situ.</p> <br><p>Stage 1 (2018-2021) of the program has been successfully completed, with ~5000 water and 3000 oyster samples collected across 13 NSW estuaries engaged in the project. Stage 2 (2021-2024) is now underway, with two further NSW estuaries engaged, and expansion of the project into Western Australia. Sample processing, data analysis and report writing will continue during this second phase, with modelling to predict oyster growth and mortality rates, including key oyster diseases such as Marteilia sydneyi (QX), and Winter Mortality, and the intensity of harmful algal blooms planned. As part of these analyses, novel qPCR assays for E. coli (bird, cow, human) and harmful algal species (Pseudo-nitzschia spp., Dinophysis spp., P. minimum), which were developed during Phase 1, will also be implemented.</p> <br><p>Preliminary results from this high frequency data have already demonstrated the link between salinity levels related to rainfall and E. coli levels. In 2019, the NSW Shellfish Program's Annual Sanitary Survey Report (DPI) stated that using this real-time, high frequency environmental data,  the CRC project provided the basis for a change to the management plans for the Pambula Lake harvest area and the Cromarty's Bay harvest area (Port Stephens). These management plan changes mean that harvest area openings and closures can be based on salinity-only data, with unnecessary extra harvest closure days avoided. As early adopters of the technology for harvest area management, an independent economic assessment by NSW DPI completed in January 2021 evaluated Pambula Lake and Cromarty's Bay. The report highlighted the positive benefits for industry through using salinity-based management plans. Focusing on the six-month period where oysters were at peak marketable condition, it was estimated that up to two extra weeks of harvest could be achieved, with a projected annual net profit boost of $15,344 (Cromarty's Bay) and $95,736 (Pambula Lake) for the study areas, based on current lease area used. The full report is available on the NSW Food Authority website.</p> <br><p>Across the NSW shellfish industry, the potential economic benefit from the use of real-time sensors for harvest area management is conservatively estimated at up to $3 million annual farm gate value. Increased revenue will improve the confidence of the industry to further invest and drive more growth. As of February 2022, thirteen salinity-only management plans had been offered for harvest areas in participating NSW estuaries, of which six were taken up and seven are under consideration.</p><br><p> More information can be found on the <a href='https://www.foodagility.com/research/transforming-australian-shellfish-production'>food agility website</a>.</p>"
